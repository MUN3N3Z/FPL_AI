This paper has several limitations that point to promising directions for future work. 

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Alternative learning approaches}: Future work could explore deep reinforcement learning approaches that might better capture complex patterns in player and team performances, potentially improving an agent's adaptability to novel season dynamics.
    \item \textbf{Hybrid Decision Systems}: Developing systems that combine reinforcement learning with rule-based heuristics for special situations (like Blank or Double Gameweeks) could address the specific weaknesses identified in our pure reinforcement learning approach.
    \item \textbf{Social Dimension Integration}: Incorporating competitive dynamics and \\mini-league considerations could better align the agent's goals with the social \\aspects that motivate many FPL participants.
\end{itemize}

While the results did not meet my initial performance expectations, they provide valuable insights into both the potential and limitations of AI in fantasy sports management. The underperformance of my agent compared to average human managers does not invalidate my approach but rather highlights the complexity of the FPL domain and the challenges of operating under realistic constraints.
