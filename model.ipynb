    "#### Modelling the sequential FPL team selection process as a Belief-State Markov Decision Process\n",
    "- For the $i$-th gameweek, we define the following terms:\n",
    "    - $M_i$ is set of matches in gameweek $i$.\n",
    "    - $P_i$ is the set of players available for selection in gameweek $i$.\n",
    "    - $A_i$ is the set of actions available in gameweek $i$, where $a \\in A_i$ is a subset of $P_i$ and observes all team selection constraints.\n",
    "    - $p_i \\in P_i$ is associated with its FPL-designated position $pos(p_i)$ and price $pr(p_i)$.\n",
    "    - $\\tau_p \\in \\tau$ is a system of distributions representing player's performance/influence on the matchplay.\n",
    "    - $O_i$ is the set of match observations in gameweek $i$\n",
    "    - $o \\in O_i$ includes both the result of the matches and the performance of the players in the selected team e.g. goals, assists, clean sheets, yellow cards, red cards, bonus points. The probability of each $o \\in O_i$ is somehow dependent on the players' characteristics ($\\tau$) i.e. a team with strong attackers is more likely to score goals, therefore, $P(o | \\tau)$ is dependent on $\\tau$.\n",
    "    - $R(o, a_{prev}, a_{curr})$ is the reward function, which returns the points scored by the selected team $a_{curr}$, given the match observations $o$. The previous team $a_{prev}$ is also provided to penalize the agent for any player poor player transfers or transfers beyond the allowed number."
